s3tsm Project Log: 

Completed: 
- Able to get all relevant data from battlefy
- Have a simple data structure to organize the battlefy data
- Have a main function which initializes that structure, correctly filling out data for a completed tournament
- Create a terminal and functions to be able to display data elements


Plans (soon):
- Come up with more terminal functions (or determine whether more are needed)
- Research s3s more to get a better understanding of it
- Create an update() function for a tournament in progress


Plans(later):
- Make modules to get data from other tournament websites (challonge, start.gg, etc)
- Add data structure objects for s3s data
- Create a clone of s3s configured to upload to s3tsm
